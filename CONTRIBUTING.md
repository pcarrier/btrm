## Getting started

### Install Nix and direnv

The project uses Nix for all tooling — the Rust toolchain, wasm-pack, pnpm, Node, process-compose, cargo-watch, and everything else. There is no `Makefile` that installs things piecemeal and no list of system dependencies to chase down. One `flake.nix` pins every tool to an exact revision, so every contributor builds with identical versions regardless of OS or distro. If it works in the dev shell, it works in CI.

direnv makes this invisible. Instead of remembering to run `nix develop` every time you `cd` into the repo, direnv evaluates `.envrc`, enters the Nix dev shell, and adds `bin/` to your PATH automatically. Leave the directory and it restores your previous environment. The result: you open a terminal, `cd blit`, and every tool is just there.

**1. Install the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

This is preferred over the official Nix installer because it enables flakes and the nix command out of the box, configures uninstall support, and works reliably on both macOS and Linux without manual `nix.conf` edits.

**2. [Install direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html)** and [hook it into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

**3. Allow the `.envrc`:**

```bash
cd blit
direnv allow
```

The first run downloads and builds the toolchain (cached after that). Once you see `blit dev shell`, you're ready.

### Without direnv

If you'd rather not install direnv, you can enter the dev shell manually:

```bash
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

You'll need to re-run this every time you open a new terminal in the repo.

## Building and testing

```bash
cargo build                      # debug build, all crates
cargo test --workspace           # all Rust tests
./bin/clippy                     # clippy (CI fails on any warning)
./bin/fmt --check                # formatting check (CI fails on any diff)
./bin/fmt                        # auto-fix formatting
./bin/lint                       # all of the above in one pass
```

`./bin/fmt` runs `cargo fmt` (Rust) and `prettier` (JS/TS/JSON/MD). `./bin/lint` runs fmt check + clippy together — this is what CI runs.

TypeScript (JS workspace — core, react, solid):

```bash
cd js && pnpm install && pnpm test
```

Or individual packages:

```bash
cd js && pnpm --filter @blit-sh/core run test
cd js && pnpm --filter @blit-sh/react run test
```

E2E (Playwright, requires built binaries):

```bash
./bin/e2e
```

CI runs `./bin/lint`, `./bin/tests`, and `./bin/e2e`. These delegate to `nix run .#<task>`, etc.

## Packaging

Every `nix run` target has a corresponding script in `bin/`:

```bash
./bin/build-debs             # .deb packages -> dist/debs/
./bin/build-tarballs         # static tarballs -> dist/tarballs/
./bin/publish-npm-packages   # npm publish @blit-sh/browser, @blit-sh/core, @blit-sh/react, @blit-sh/solid, @blit-sh/solid
./bin/publish-crates         # cargo publish
```

`build-debs` and `build-tarballs` accept an optional output directory argument (default `dist/debs` and `dist/tarballs`).
The version and platform are derived from `flake.nix` and the build host.
Linkage is verified at `nix build` time — Linux binaries must be statically linked and macOS binaries must not reference nix-store dylibs.

Individual packages can also be built directly:

```bash
nix build .#blit-server      # or blit-cli, blit-gateway
nix build .#blit-server-deb  # or blit-cli-deb, blit-gateway-deb
```

There is no `rustfmt.toml` or `.clippy.toml` — default rustfmt, prettier, and `clippy -D warnings` are the style enforcement. `./bin/fmt` runs both formatters in one pass.

## Dev environment

`./bin/dev` starts the full stack with hot-reloading via `process-compose`:

| Process        | What it does                                                      | Port / socket        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `browser-wasm` | Watches `crates/browser/src` + `crates/remote/src`, rebuilds WASM | n/a                  |
| `server`       | `cargo watch` running `blit-server --release`                     | `/tmp/blit-dev.sock` |
| `gateway`      | `cargo watch` running `blit-gateway --release` (pass=`dev`)       | `127.0.0.1:3266`     |
| `web-app`      | Vite dev server for `js/web-app/`                                 | printed by Vite      |
| `website`      | Vite dev server for `js/website/`                                 | printed by Vite      |

## Project structure

Most Rust crates are one or two source files. `blit-cli` is split into five and `blit-webrtc-forwarder` uses a multi-file module tree.

| File                                 | Lines | Role                                                                                                             |

## Code conventions

**Flat crate layout.** Don't introduce deep `mod` trees. If a crate grows, add files at the same level (like `cli/src/agent.rs`) and `mod` them from the root. `blit-webrtc-forwarder` is the one exception with a multi-file module tree.

**Wire protocol changes** touch multiple layers. A new message type requires:

1. Constants and `ServerMsg`/parse case in `remote/src/lib.rs`
2. A `msg_*()` builder function in `remote/src/lib.rs`
3. Server handler in `server/src/main.rs`
4. Client-side handling in `cli/src/agent.rs` (agent subcommands) and/or `cli/src/interactive.rs` (TUI)
5. Update the protocol tables in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Tests live next to the code.** `server/src/lib.rs` has a `#[cfg(test)]` module at the bottom. `cli/src/agent.rs` has its own test module with `MockServer`/`MockPty` — an in-process test harness using Unix socket pairs. Core tests are in `core/src/__tests__/`, React tests in `react/src/__tests__/`.

**Release profile** uses `opt-level = 3`, LTO, `codegen-units = 1`, and `panic = "abort"`. Linux binaries are statically linked via musl; Nix verifies this at build time.

## Versioning and releases

All workspace crates, `js/core/package.json`, `js/react/package.json`, `js/solid/package.json`, and `nix/common.nix` share a single version number. The JS packages live in a pnpm workspace rooted at `js/` with a shared `js/pnpm-lock.yaml`. The `bin/release` script bumps all of them atomically:

```bash
./bin/release 0.12.0
```

This validates version consistency, bumps all files, runs `cargo test -p blit-server`, and commits. CI on the resulting `v*` tag builds debs/tarballs, publishes to crates.io and npm, updates the Homebrew tap, and deploys the APT repo.

## CI checks

PRs must be reviewed and pass the following CI checks before merging:

| Check                  | What it covers                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `lint`                 | Formatting (`cargo fmt --check` + `prettier --check`) and clippy (`./bin/lint`)                                                            |
| `e2e`                  | Playwright end-to-end tests (`./bin/e2e`)                                                                                                  |
| `dev-check`            | Full-stack smoke test: starts dev services via `process-compose`, waits for health, exercises the CLI, then tears down (`./bin/dev-check`) |
| `test (macos-latest)`  | Rust and JS test suite on macOS                                                                                                            |
| `test (ubuntu-latest)` | Rust and JS test suite on Ubuntu                                                                                                           |

## Guardrails

- `./bin/lint` is the CI gate (fmt + clippy). Run `./bin/fmt` to auto-fix formatting and `./bin/clippy` to check clippy warnings before pushing.
- The WASM crate (`crates/browser/`) targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — don't add dependencies that pull in `std::net`, `std::fs`, etc.
- `crates/browser/pkg/` is gitignored. It must be built locally (`./bin/build-browser`) before the web-app or React tests will work.
- The server uses raw `libc` calls (`openpty`, `waitpid`, `kill`, `ioctl`) — changes to PTY lifecycle code need careful attention to signal safety and fd leaks.
- The background zombie reaper (`waitpid(-1, ..., WNOHANG)` every 5s in the server) can race with `cleanup_pty`'s `waitpid` for the specific child. This is intentional — `cleanup_pty` uses `WNOHANG` so it doesn't block if the reaper already collected the child.
