# blit CLI

Drive terminal sessions programmatically through stateless CLI subcommands. Each subcommand opens a fresh connection, performs one operation, and exits.

## Quick reference

```bash
blit list                                 # TSV: ID  TAG  TITLE  STATUS
blit start --cols 200                     # start default shell, print session ID
blit start --cols 200 htop                # start a specific command
blit start -t build --cols 200 make -j8   # tag it for later reference
blit start --rows 40 --cols 200 htop      # control terminal dimensions
blit show 3                               # current viewport text (plain)
blit show 3 --ansi                        # current viewport with ANSI colors
blit history 3                            # full scrollback + viewport
blit history 3 --from-end 0 --limit 50    # last 50 lines
blit history 3 --from-start 0 --limit 50  # first 50 lines
blit send 3 "ls -la\n"                    # type a command (note the \n)
blit show 3 --rows 40 --cols 200          # resize before capturing viewport
blit history 3 --cols 200                 # resize before reading scrollback
blit restart 3                            # restart an exited session
blit close 3                              # destroy the session
```

**Always start sessions with `--cols 200`** (or wider). The default is 80 columns, which causes line wrapping that makes output difficult to parse. Pass `--cols` to `show`/`history` to resize an existing session before reading.

## `show` vs `history`

These are the two ways to read terminal output. Getting this distinction right is critical.

| | `show` | `history` |
|---|---|---|
| **What it returns** | Current viewport — exactly what a human would see on screen right now | Full scrollback buffer + viewport |
| **When to use** | Quick glance at current state (e.g. is the prompt back?) | Reading command output that may have scrolled off-screen |
| **Gotcha** | If a command produced more output than fits on screen, earlier output is lost | Returns everything, which can be very large for long-running commands |

**Rule of thumb:** Use `history --from-end 0 --limit N` when you need recent output. Use `show` when you only care about what's visible right now (e.g. checking for a prompt).

## Running commands

`blit start` creates a PTY and prints its session ID. Pass a command directly or omit it to start the user's default shell:

```bash
ID=$(blit start --cols 200 ls -la)     # run a command
ID=$(blit start --cols 200)            # start a shell
```

The command runs asynchronously — `start` returns as soon as the PTY is created, not when the command finishes. Poll with `show` or `history` to read output.

### Waiting for output

There is no built-in "wait for command to finish" mechanism. Poll until the session exits or a known marker appears:

```bash
# For one-shot commands: poll until the process exits
for i in $(seq 1 50); do
  blit list | grep -P "^$ID\t" | grep -q 'exited' && break
  sleep 0.2
done
blit history "$ID" --from-end 0 --limit 20

# For interactive sessions: poll for a shell prompt
for i in $(seq 1 50); do
  blit history "$ID" --from-end 0 --limit 3 | grep -q '\$ $' && break
  sleep 0.2
done

# For commands with known end markers
for i in $(seq 1 150); do
  blit history "$ID" --from-end 0 --limit 5 | grep -qE 'BUILD (SUCCESS|FAILURE)' && break
  sleep 0.2
done
```

**Do not assume a command has finished after `start` or `send`.** Always poll to confirm.

## Session lifecycle

Sessions persist as long as the blit daemon is running. They are **not** cleaned up automatically.

- A session stays alive until you `close` it or the process inside it exits.
- If the process exits on its own, the session remains in the `list` output with an `exited(N)` status. It still consumes resources until explicitly closed.
- Use `blit restart ID` to re-run an exited session with its original command, size, and tag. Fails if the session is still running.
- Sessions do **not** persist across daemon restarts.
- **Clean up after yourself.** Always `close` sessions when you are done. Leaked sessions accumulate and waste resources.

```bash
# Restart a failed build
blit restart "$ID"

# Clean up a specific session
blit close "$ID"

# Check for leaked sessions
blit list
```

## Transport options

By default, `blit` connects to the local daemon via its default Unix socket. Use these global flags (before the subcommand) to connect elsewhere:

| Flag                      | Description                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `-s`, `--socket <SOCKET>` | Connect to a specific Unix socket |
| `--tcp <TCP>`             | Connect via raw TCP (`HOST:PORT`) |
| `--ssh <SSH>`             | Connect via SSH to a remote host  |

```bash
blit --socket /tmp/blit.sock list
blit --tcp 192.168.1.10:7890 show 1
blit --ssh dev-server start bash
```

## Output conventions

- `list` prints tab-separated values with a header row. Parse on `\t`.
  - STATUS column: `running`, `exited(N)` (normal exit with code N), `signal(N)` (killed by signal N), or `exited` (exit status unknown).
- `start` prints a single integer (the new session ID) to stdout.
- `show` and `history` print terminal text to stdout, one line per terminal row. Trailing whitespace per row is trimmed.
- `send`, `restart`, and `close` produce no stdout on success.
- All errors go to stderr. Exit code is non-zero on failure.

## Escape sequences

`send` supports C-style escapes: `\n` (newline/enter), `\r` (carriage return), `\t` (tab), `\\` (literal backslash), `\0` (NUL), `\xHH` (hex byte).

| Action                 | Input                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Press Enter            | `\n`                                                              |
| Press Ctrl+C           | `\x03`                                                            |
| Press Ctrl+D (EOF)     | `\x04`                                                            |
| Press Ctrl+Z (suspend) | `\x1a`                                                            |
| Press Escape           | `\x1b`                                                            |
| Arrow keys             | `\x1b[A` (up), `\x1b[B` (down), `\x1b[C` (right), `\x1b[D` (left) |
| Quit vim               | `\x1b:q!\n`                                                       |

For multi-byte payloads or binary data, pipe through stdin:

```bash
printf '\x1b:wq\n' | blit send 3 -
```

## Pagination

`history` supports pagination from either direction:

```bash
# Forward pagination (from oldest)
blit history 3 --from-start 0 --limit 100    # lines 0-99
blit history 3 --from-start 100 --limit 100  # lines 100-199

# Backward pagination (from newest)
blit history 3 --from-end 0 --limit 100      # last 100 lines
blit history 3 --from-end 100 --limit 100    # 100 lines before those
```

Without `--from-start` or `--from-end`, all lines are returned.

## ANSI mode

By default, `show` and `history` return plain text with colors stripped. Pass `--ansi` to preserve ANSI SGR escape sequences (colors, bold, underline, etc). This is useful when color carries semantic meaning (e.g. red errors in compiler output, colored diffs).

## Guidelines

- Tag sessions with `-t` so you can identify them in `list` output without tracking IDs.
- Check exit status in `list`. The STATUS column shows `exited(0)` for success, `exited(1)` for failure, `signal(9)` for SIGKILL, etc.
- Do not try to parse `show` or `history` output as structured data. It is terminal text with possible line wrapping and cursor artifacts.
